# Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹
## My name is Tyler Brown, I am working in Web Development under the IDD program at SAIT
<p>I a 19, work at the YMCA in Seton as a lifeguard and wish to go into the film and video production expertise once I am finished with school</p>
<p>My favorite Movie is either <em>Dr. Strange</em> or <em>Split</em>. And my favorite Video Game is 100% Resident Evil: Village</p>
<p>I'm excited to get to know more about coding and Web Dev over this course and to hopefully get to know my classmates more aswell.</p>
